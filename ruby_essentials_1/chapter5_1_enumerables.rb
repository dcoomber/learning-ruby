# Notes
# * Countable items
# * Arrays / Ranges / Hashes
# * Strings (sort of, but doesn't work for multi-byte characters - are we enumarating the characters or the bytes)
# * Includes the enumerable module
# * Look at the documentation for enumerables (see common methods)
# * Essential methods - count, each, first, last, each_with_index, include?
# * max, min (if comparable)
